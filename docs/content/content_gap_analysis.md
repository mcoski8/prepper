3. **Crisis UI is the differentiator** - Information architecture matters most
4. **Practical beats theoretical** - Focus on what people will actually use
5. **Scenarios over apocalypse** - Real emergencies, not fantasy

The gap analysis now prioritizes market-driven needs over comprehensive coverage, creating a sustainable product strategy that can grow with user demands.
