# Tier 1 Content Acquisition Report

Generated: 2025-07-31  
Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully downloaded several critical Tier 1 components, but key gaps remain. The tiered strategy is validated - we already have most core survival content and need to focus on curation and UI rather than massive downloads.

## Critical Gaps for Tier 1 Launch

### 1. WikiHow Curated Content (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Need**: 10,000 emergency-relevant articles
- **Status**: Not started
- **Action**: Contact WikiHow for licensing or implement scraper
- **Alternative**: Create our own quick guides based on existing content

### 2. Plant Identification Images
- **Have**: Text databases and poisonous plants PDF
- **Need**: High-res photos for visual ID
- **Action**: Use USDA data to query iNaturalist API
- **Size**: ~3GB for 1000 plants

### 3. Emergency Communications
- **Have**: Basic info in Wikipedia
- **Need**: Practical frequency lists, HAM basics
- **Action**: 
  - Re-download FCC database with better method
  - Create regional frequency cards
  - Add emergency channel guide

### 4. Crisis Navigation UI (CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR)
- **Need**: Decision trees, symptom checkers
- **Status**: Design phase
- **Action**: Build UI framework linking to existing content

### 5. Quick Reference Cards
- **Need**: 200+ printable cards
- **Status**: Not started
- **Action**: Extract key points from existing content

## Size Analysis

### Current Tier Breakdown
- **Tier 1 Ready**: ~5GB (medical, survival, water, repairs)
- **Tier 2 Content**: ~2GB (energy, some homesteading)
- **Tier 3 Content**: ~167GB (Wikipedia, Gutenberg, educational)
- **Maps**: ~17GB (could be Tier 2)

### Target Sizes
- **Tier 1**: 32-64GB (need 27-59GB more content)
- **Tier 2**: +128GB (have good foundation)
- **Tier 3**: +256GB (already have 167GB)

## Immediate Actions Required

### Week 1 Priority
1. **Fix Appropedia download** - Should be 1.1GB not 512KB
2. **WikiHow partnership** - Email content-partnerships@wikihow.com
3. **FCC database** - Use alternative download method
4. **Plant images** - Set up iNaturalist API pipeline

### Week 2 Priority
1. **Crisis UI mockups** - Design decision trees
2. **Quick cards** - Create templates and extract content
3. **Process plant data** - Build searchable database
4. **Test offline search** - Verify Tantivy integration

## Recommendations

### Strategic Shift Validated
The tiered approach is correct. We have too much Tier 3 (archival) content and need more Tier 1 (practical) content. Focus should be on:
1. **Curation over accumulation**
2. **UI/UX over raw data**
3. **Scenario-based organization**
4. **Quick access tools**

### Content Reorganization
Move existing content to appropriate tiers:
- Wikipedia → Tier 3 only
- Gutenberg → Tier 3 only  
- Medical, survival, water → Tier 1 core
- iFixit → Tier 1/2 bridge
- Maps → Tier 2 primary

### Partnership Opportunities
1. **WikiHow** - Critical for Tier 1
2. **iNaturalist** - Plant photos
3. **ARRL** - Amateur radio content
4. **Local extension offices** - Regional guides

## Conclusion

We have a solid foundation with 195GB of content, but it's poorly organized for emergency use. The Tier 1 gaps are manageable - roughly 20-30GB of curated content plus UI development. Focus on partnerships and curation rather than mass downloading.

The differentiator isn't content volume but emergency-optimized access.
