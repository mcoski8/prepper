# Sprint 6 Week 2 Summary

## Completed This Session

### 1. Professional Persona Updates
- Renamed personas from cutesy names to professional titles:
  - Tier 1: The Practical Prepper
  - Tier 2: The Self-Sufficient Homesteader  
  - Tier 3: The Knowledge Archivist

### 2. Content Acquisition Infrastructure
Created comprehensive download system:
- `tier1_downloads.json` - Manifest of critical content sources
- `download_tier1_content.py` - Safe download manager with resume support
- `tier1_curl_download.sh` - Alternative curl-based downloader
- `process_plant_data.py` - Plant database processor

### 3. Content Downloads Attempted
Successfully downloaded:
- ✅ Post-disaster survival guide (615MB)
- ✅ Water purification guide (20MB)
- ✅ Medicine collection (67MB)
- ✅ Wikipedia Medical (2GB)
- ✅ Poisonous Plants PDF (4.5MB)

Failed downloads (authentication/access issues):
- ❌ USDA plant databases (got HTML instead of data)
- ❌ FCC amateur radio database (incomplete, 292 bytes)

### 4. Strategic Decisions
- **Skip USDA/FCC databases** - Not critical for Tier 1, access issues
- **Focus on existing content** - We have 195GB, need better processing
- **Prioritize WikiHow partnership** - Most valuable new content source

### 5. Documentation Created
- `tiered_personas.md` - Professional market segmentation
- `tier1_acquisition_report.md` - Download status and gaps
- `tier1_action_plan.md` - Next steps for content processing
- `pdf_extraction_plan.md` - Technical pipeline for PDF processing

## Key Insights

1. **Content Volume vs Navigation**: We don't need more data, we need better access
2. **Human Validation Critical**: Survival content requires expert review
3. **ZIM/FlatBuffers Integration**: Need to clarify packaging strategy
4. **Crisis UI is Differentiator**: Fast navigation matters more than data volume

## Next Immediate Step: PDF Extraction Pipeline

Building a Python pipeline to process existing PDFs:
1. Extract text and images from survival PDFs
2. Structure content with chapters, keywords, priorities
3. Convert to FlatBuffers for zero-parse overhead
4. Package in ZIM files for offline access
5. **Critical**: Human validation for medical/safety content

## Technical Stack Decisions
- Use `pdfplumber` over PyPDF2 (better table handling)
- Add `camelot` for complex table extraction
- Start with simple TF-IDF keyword extraction
- Manual tagging for emergency priorities
- WebP format for all images (better compression)

## Next Session Focus
Implement the PDF extraction pipeline starting with the smallest file (PoisonousPlants.pdf) as a test case, then scale to larger medical guides.
