## Space Analysis
- Used: 178GB
- Available: 914GB
- Plenty of room for all content!

## Priority Recommendation
You have all critical Tier 1 content and most Tier 2. The OSM North America download will give you essential offline maps. The remaining content is nice-to-have but not critical for basic survival scenarios.
