<body>
<h1>Hemorrhage Control</h1>
<p>Hemorrhage or severe bleeding is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action. 
The primary methods of hemorrhage control include direct pressure, elevation, pressure points, 
and tourniquets. Time is critical - severe arterial bleeding can lead to death within minutes.</p>

<h2>Direct Pressure</h2>
<p>Apply firm, direct pressure to the wound using sterile gauze or clean cloth. Maintain 
pressure for at least 10-15 minutes without lifting to check. If blood soaks through, 
add more material on top without removing the original dressing.</p>

<h2>Tourniquet Application</h2>
<p>For severe extremity bleeding that cannot be controlled with direct pressure:
1. Apply tourniquet 2-3 inches above the wound (never on a joint)
2. Tighten until bleeding stops
3. Note the time of application
4. Do not remove once applied - seek immediate medical help</p>

<head><title>Anaphylaxis Emergency Treatment</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Anaphylaxis Emergency Treatment</h1>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate 
treatment with epinephrine. Common triggers include foods, insect stings, medications, 
and latex. Symptoms develop rapidly and can be fatal within minutes.</p>

<h2>Recognition</h2>
<p>Signs include: difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat, rapid pulse, skin rash, 
nausea/vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Any two body systems affected indicates anaphylaxis.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>1. Administer epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) immediately
2. Call emergency services
3. Position patient lying flat with legs elevated
4. Give second dose after 5-15 minutes if no improvement
5. Begin CPR if patient becomes unresponsive</p>

<body>
<h1>Hypothermia Treatment</h1>
<p>Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C). It can be 
life-threatening and requires careful treatment to prevent cardiac arrest during rewarming.</p>

<h2>Stages</h2>
<p>Mild (90-95°F): Shivering, impaired judgment
Moderate (82-90°F): Shivering stops, muscle rigidity, confusion
Severe (<82°F): Unconscious, cardiac arrhythmias, appears dead</p>

<h2>Field Treatment</h2>
<p>1. Prevent further heat loss - move to shelter
2. Handle gently to prevent cardiac arrest
3. Insulate entire body including head
4. Apply heat packs to trunk (not extremities)
5. Give warm, sweet drinks if conscious
6. Evacuate for medical care</p>
