<h1>Hemorrhage Control</h1>
<p>Hemorrhage or severe bleeding is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action. 
The primary methods of hemorrhage control include direct pressure, elevation, pressure points, 
and tourniquets. Time is critical - severe arterial bleeding can lead to death within minutes.</p>

<h2>Direct Pressure</h2>
<p>Apply firm, direct pressure to the wound using sterile gauze or clean cloth. Maintain 
pressure for at least 10-15 minutes without lifting to check. If blood soaks through, 
add more material on top without removing the original dressing.</p>

<h2>Tourniquet Application</h2>
<p>For severe extremity bleeding that cannot be controlled with direct pressure:
1. Apply tourniquet 2-3 inches above the wound (never on a joint)
2. Tighten until bleeding stops
3. Note the time of application
4. Do not remove once applied - seek immediate medical help</p>
