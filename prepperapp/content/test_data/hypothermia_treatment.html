<h1>Hypothermia Treatment</h1>
<p>Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C). It can be 
life-threatening and requires careful treatment to prevent cardiac arrest during rewarming.</p>

<h2>Stages</h2>
<p>Mild (90-95°F): Shivering, impaired judgment
Moderate (82-90°F): Shivering stops, muscle rigidity, confusion
Severe (<82°F): Unconscious, cardiac arrhythmias, appears dead</p>

<h2>Field Treatment</h2>
<p>1. Prevent further heat loss - move to shelter
2. Handle gently to prevent cardiac arrest
3. Insulate entire body including head
4. Apply heat packs to trunk (not extremities)
5. Give warm, sweet drinks if conscious
6. Evacuate for medical care</p>
