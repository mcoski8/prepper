- **Offline Capable**: No internet required
- **Sub-second Results**: Even with 220GB indexed

## Content Categorization Examples

### Why Project Gutenberg is Tier 3
Project Gutenberg's 60,000+ books serve multiple purposes in a post-disaster scenario:
- **Morale & Mental Health**: Fiction provides escape and stress relief
- **Education**: Preserving literature for teaching future generations
- **Technical References**: Many old engineering/craft books are invaluable
- **Cultural Preservation**: Maintaining human knowledge beyond mere survival

### Other Tier 3 Rationale
- **Full Wikipedia**: Too large for phones, but invaluable for rebuilding (how to make concrete, refine metals, etc.)
- **Detailed Maps**: 50GB is massive but knowing every water source, elevation, and back road could save communities
- **Wikibooks/Wikiversity**: Complete educational system for when schools don't exist
- **iFixit (full)**: Not just emergency repairs, but maintaining technology long-term

### What Stays in Tier 2
Content that's immediately actionable and worth memorizing:
- **Basic Survival Skills**: Should practice these before disaster
- **Regional Plant Guides**: Need to know YOUR area's plants
- **Emergency Comms**: Radio protocols you'll use in first month
- **Family Care**: Age-specific dosing, child CPR variations
